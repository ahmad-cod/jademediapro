        note: "Your brand is how people view you when they interact with your company—both the ones you can influence and the ones you can't. Branding is to increase the apparent value of a firm or its products to customers, hence increasing brand franchise and brand share values. Having a very good brand also enables manufacturers to charge more for the product. The value of the brand is determined by how much profit it generates for the manufacturer. This makes brand management a very important aspect of a company’s growth. Brand recognition is earned by a brand that is well-known in the marketplace. When a brand's recognition has grown to the point where it has widespread positive feelings in the market, it has reached brand franchise. One of the critical goals in brand recognition is building a brand to the extent that the brand can be widely identified without the name of the company present. Apple Inc. is an example of a company that has built a very successful brand. The logo, seen anywhere, will raise a feeling of quality, luxury, and reliability in consumers anywhere in the world. Companies like McDonald’s, Coca-Cola, Google, Iker, and many more have also built a very successful brand which makes acceptability easy when new products are introduced. Some elements of branding include the; Logos (main logo, secondary logos, and icons), color palettes and schemes, typography, other images to be used, the voice and tone behind writings must all pass a message, clearly representing your company’s core values. Branding is a marketing strategy, the totality of ideas, imagery, pictures taken into consideration helps to form consumers’ perspectives about a product. So branding is a marketing strategy, and the brand is what has a meaning to the consumer. The term brand can be understood as many things, which can be summarized as follows; It is simply a logo e.g., the Mark that signifies NIKE. It is a company e.g., Coca-Cola. It/’s a risk reducer. The brand reassures of quality, even in unfamiliar territory. Branding means positioning. Branding helps in the categorization of brands in terms of quality, speed of delivery, and reliability in the minds of consumers. It is a cluster of values e.g., Telegram is reliable, ethical, invaluable, innovative, and so on. It signifies added value, where the consumer sees value in a brand over its competitors e.g., Apple EarPods over other brands of earbuds, a Versace branded shirt over a non-branded shirt, and Volkswagen over Skoda – despite similarities.",
